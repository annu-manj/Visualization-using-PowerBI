**Recommendations:**  
1.Since most attrition happens within the first 0-2 years, focus on onboarding and early career development programs to reduce early turnover.  
2.Investigate the reasons behind high attrition in roles such as Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist, and implement role-specific retention strategies.  
3.Since most attrition occurs in the lower salary ranges (up to 5k), consider reviewing the compensation packages to ensure they are competitive and fair.  
4.Enhance Job Satisfaction  
5.Support for Life Sciences and Technical Degree Holders  
6.Age-Specific Retention Programs: Since a significant portion of attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group, consider age-specific retention initiatives, such as career progression opportunities and work-life balance support.
